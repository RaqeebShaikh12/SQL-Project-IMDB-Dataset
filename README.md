# SQL-Project-IMDB-DATASET

This repository contains a dataset of movies and genre from IMDB, along with SQL queries to analyze the data. The data has been provided by upGrad as part of their Data Science program.

## Dataset

The dataset contain 3 files:

* IMDB_DATABASE: It contains different table in the database such as movie, genre, rating and other tables.
* IMDB_Dataset: It contains information about tables and ERD of the dataset.
* IMDB_Analysis: In this I have written some SQL queries to analyze and find insight about the movies using other column.

## Requirements

To get started, you'll need to have access to a SQL database. The queries in this repository are written for MySQL, but they should be easily adaptable to other SQL database systems.

You'll also need to have the IMDB dataset loaded into your SQL database. The dataset is provided in the CSV file, which can be loaded into a SQL database using a tool like MySQL Workbench.

Once you have your SQL database set up and the IMDB dataset loaded, you can start running the SQL queries in this repository.

## SQL Queries

I have used SQL to gain insights and answer various questions related to the IMDB dataset as requested by upGrad. The file IMDB_Analysis includes queries, comments, and clear instructions on the objectives to be achieved.
